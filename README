AILadder gridclient branch migrates AILadder to a client of springgrid

AILadder gridclient's goals and philosophy are:
- provide a website that lets AI devs upload their AIs and see easily how they fair against other AIs on a range of maps and playing conditions

botrunner contains the botrunner, that runs spring games on any pc
somewhere

webserver/website contains the code for the website
webserver/website/db contains the sql to create tables on the webserver db, 
targeting mysql
